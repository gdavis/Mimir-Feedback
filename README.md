# Mimir ‚Äì Bug Reports & Feedback
üëã Hello there! This is the place for sending bug reports and feedback for the [macOS and iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mimir-powerful-podcasts/id1508343025) podcast app Mimir. This project is created and managed by just me, so while it may take some time for me to get to all the issues reported, I do want to hear your feedback and fix bugs as soon as I can.

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to making Mimir a better app!

## Using Github
Github is a free and awesome tool many developers use to help create their apps. You will need an account to submit issues and feedback for Mimir. Creating an account is free and easy to do, so don't let that hold you back from contributing! 

Once you have created or commented on an issue, you will also receive updates whenever there are additional comments or status changes made from the developer, keeping you in the loop on its progress.

If you need to create a Github account, [click here to signup.](https://github.com/signup)

## Search for your issue
Before submitting a new bug report or feedback, please first check the [Issues](https://github.com/gdavis/Mimir-Feedback/issues) tab to see if your bug/feature request/feedback has already been reported by another user. You can do this by using the search feature to find issues that might be related to what you want to report. You can also leave comments on issues from other users, so please feel free to add your feedback to any other open issue.

If you haven't found an existing issue about what you want to report, continue reading and send me a new issue!

## How do I send a bug report?
Once you know you have a new bug, use the [Issues](https://github.com/gdavis/Mimir-Feedback/issues) tab and [create a new issue.](https://github.com/gdavis/Mimir-Feedback/issues/new/choose)

Next you will be asked to choose a form to complete for the platform you found the bug on. Here you can also choose a feedback form if you do not have a specific bug to report ([See Below](https://github.com/gdavis/Mimir-Feedback/edit/main/README.md#how-do-i-send-a-feature-request-or-other-feedback)).

From here you can follow the form to provide information on the bug. The hardest part about fixing issues in the app is being able to reproduce them, so please be as descriptive as possible when creating your issue. The best bug reports are ones that describe a step-by-step process to make the bug occur consistently. You can also attach screenshots and videos to your issue which can greatly help me understand the issue. 

Check out these links to find out how to add screenshots or video:

| How to take a screenshot | How to record the screen |
| --- | --- |
| [iOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT200289) | [iOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207935) |
| [macOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201361) | [macOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208721) |

## How do I send a feature request or other feedback?
Submitting feedback is just like submitting a bug, just [create a new issue](https://github.com/gdavis/Mimir-Feedback/issues/new/choose) and choose the template that best matches the feedback you want to provide. Please check other existing issues before submitting so we don't have a lot of duplicates!

If you want to show that you're also interested in an existing feature request or feedback, use the "+" button on an issue and add a üëç (+1) reaction to the issue. This counter lets me know how many people are interested in the same feature and also cuts down on everyone having to add a "me too!" comment to the issue.

## What if I just have something nice to say?
Aren't you just wonderful! ‚ù§Ô∏è This is the place to report bugs or ask for things that might not be in the app yet, so if you want to tell me something you like about the apps, [just send me an email](mailto:grant@mimirpodcasts.app)!
