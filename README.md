# Mimir – Bug Tracking & Feedback
👋 Hello there! This is the place for sending bug reports and feedback for the podcast app Mimir; available on both macOS and iOS devices. Mimir is created by just one developer, so while it may some time for me to get to all the issues reported, I do want to hear your feedback and fix bugs as soon as I can.

Thank you for taking the time to help make Mimir a better app!

## Using Github
Github is a free and awesome tool many developers use to help create their apps. You will need an account to submit issues and feedback for Mimir. Creating an account is free and easy to do, so please don't let that hold you back from contributing! 

Once you have created an issue, you will also receive updates whenever there are comments or status changes made from the developer, keeping you in the loop on its progress.

## How do I send a bug report?
Before submitting a new bug report, please first check the [Issues](https://github.com/gdavis/Mimir-Feedback/issues) tab to see if your bug has already been reported by another user. You can do this by using the search feature to find issues that might be related to what you want to report. You can also leave comments on issues from other users, so please feel free to add your feedback to any other open issue.

Once you have determined your bug has not yet been reported, use the [Issues](https://github.com/gdavis/Mimir-Feedback/issues) tab and [create a new issue.](https://github.com/gdavis/Mimir-Feedback/issues/new/choose)

Next you will be asked to choose an issue template for the type of bug you are reporting. You can also send general feedback on an app if you do not have a specific bug to report ([See Below](https://github.com/gdavis/Mimir-Feedback/edit/main/README.md#how-do-i-send-a-feature-request-or-other-feedback).

From here you can follow the template to provide information on the bug. The hardest part about fixing issues in the app is being able to reproduce them, so please be as descriptive as possible when creating your issue. The best bug reports are ones that describe a step-by-step process to make the bug occur consistently. You can also attach screenshots and videos to your issue which greatly help demonstrating the issue.
